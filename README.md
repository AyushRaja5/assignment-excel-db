This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.

## How to start Application on localhost : Once you clone this repo, go to frontendapp folder and open terminal.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies specified in my package.json file. It ensures that all the required packages are downloaded and ready to use.
I have used only one dependency. {"xlsx": "^0.18.5"} so you ca run `npm i xlsx`.

Run `ng serve` on terminal for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Clone the backend repo from my `assignment-server-excel-db` repo

## Once backend is setup:
refresh the frontend app, you will see `Backend Connected : Welcome to Ayush MEAN journey` on terminal.
